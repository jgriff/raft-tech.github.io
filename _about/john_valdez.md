about: John was born in Hawaii, but actually "saw" it for the first time in 2009 during an extended honeymoon with his wife and their son. He grew up and spent most of his life in the Silicon Valley, which somewhat dictating his chosen background in anything IT or computer-related. For the past 3 years, he has lived in the San Diego area. He enjoys daily walks alone, with his family, or with his Chow Chow, Grizzly. He loves mountain biking, listening to music, hanging out with the family, and discovering areas in San Diego and Southern California that he hasn't visited. He has an insatiable desire to learn more when it comes to computer technology.
